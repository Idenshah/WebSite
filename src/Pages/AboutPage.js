        <h3>Program Skills</h3>
        <p className="aboutMe">
          I've cultivated a diverse skill set that empowers me to transform
          ideas into digital realities. My proficiency encompasses a wide array
          of programming languages, including JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET (Razor
          Page), PHP, and Python, enabling me to create interactive web
          applications, versatile software solutions, and captivating user
          interfaces. I also specialize in crafting visually appealing and
          structurally sound web content using HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p className="aboutMe">
          To enhance the user experience and streamline development, I leverage
          the React JavaScript library and the Bootstrap front-end framework.
          This combination allows me to build dynamic and responsive web
          applications efficiently. In terms of data management, I am adept at
          working with SQL for efficient handling of relational databases. My
          expertise extends to the use of MySQL as a database management system,
          ensuring data organization and retrieval are seamless and efficient.
